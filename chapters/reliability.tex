% Talk about why initialisation could be a failing point, how to fix that (e.g remove the recycle, or save initialisation states)

% picture of the data (look it's not so sparodic anymore)

% The heat exchangers are the most complex unit operation, and they often failed to initialise, we can swap them for heaters and coolers to see if that helps. we weren't using them properly anyway.

% Maybe mention scaling?

% is there any other preprocessing steps we could do? Should we add specification blocks?

% what does this prove about the architecture?
