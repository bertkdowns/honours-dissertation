\section{Motivation}

The World Economic Forum ranked ``Failure to mitigate climate change" as the number one threat to the world in the next ten years~\cite{GlobalRisksReport}, due to the effects climate change has on extreme weather events, biodiversity, and climate-vulnerable economies. Decarbonisation is a crucial step in mitigating climate change. In New Zealand, process heat accounts for 8\% of total greenhouse emissions~\cite{DecarbonisingProcessHeat}.

Ahuora is a research group focused on developing smart energy systems to decarbonise factories. They have developed a Web-based simulation platform that allows users to create a digital twin of their factory.
This platform is based on steady-state simulation, which simulates a factory at a single point in time. All factory conditions are manually specified by the user.
This platform is useful for modelling changes to a factory before construction, or understanding the factory's performance under different conditions.

At the current stage of development, the Ahuora platform cannot be considered a ``Digital Twin'' because it does not take into account the factory's real-time state.
By integrating real-time sensor data into the simulation, the platform can monitor the factories' performance, and suggest tunings that will optimise resource efficiency.
The data can also be used to predict and avoid failures and downtime, a key problem where many resources are wasted.
Additionally, models created in the Ahuora Simulation Platform during the design phase could also be used during operation, minimising overhead costs.

Including real-time data in the simulation is needed to improve the usefulness of the Ahuora Platform in industry.
The system needs to meet industry requirements for security, scalability, and reliability. As such, this project
has been commissioned to develop a standardised framework to enable the integration of real-time sensor data into the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform.

% Todo: Include a substantial section explaining the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform, and what it does. THis is a necessary background for the project. The marker won't understand otherwise.

\section{Objectives}

The objectives of this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    % Literature review has already been conducted, so this is not necessary
    %\item Conduct a literature review on Digital Twins, Digital Twin Platforms, and Data Processing Tools.
    \item Conduct an Exploratory Analysis of techniques and tools for digital twin development, based on their applicability to the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform and the requirements of live data processing.
    \item Develop the Ahuora Digital Twin platform to a stage where support for live data processing can be added.
    \item Develop a standardised framework for integrating real-time sensor data into the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform.
    \item Develop a prototype implementation of the framework.
    \item Evaluate the prototype implementation in a case study.
    \item Identify areas for future work.
\end{itemize}
\section{Scope}

Full integration of real-time sensor data into the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform is out of scope for this project.
This project will focus on identifying techniques and tools for simulation and modelling that will be needed in a industry setting,
and developing a prototype live data processing system for Ahuora that is extensible enough to support those techniques and tools.
