# Bert Downs - Honours Dissertation

This repository contains the code and final products of my honors dissertation, focused on building a framework to process live data in the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform. This process involves a number of different domains, as well as understanding of software architecture of large-scale systems, mathematical modelling and optimisation, machine learning, thermodynamics, and chemical engineering.
