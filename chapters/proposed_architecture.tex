\chapter{Proposed System Architecture}

% I'm thinking this could be a bit like a whitepaper, where I outline the requirements for the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform, and how I think it should be implemented.
% then the other sections can go into more depth, to confirm my argument that this is the best way to implement the platform.

% Digital Twin Software needs to suit the use cases of Network Administrators, Chemical Engineers, Process Engineers, and Operators to be useful in industry.
% Steady-State, Dynamic, and Surrogate modelling are all required to support the different use cases.
% A Digital Twin platform needs to integrate with existing SCADA systems and data processing tools to be useful in industry.

% Simulation results need to be avalible within the platform, but this should not replace the company's existing knowledge base/data lake/logging.
% There is no need for Ahuora to develop a new data processing platform, as SCADA systems or things such as kafka/mqtt do this fine.
% It should be easy to switch between design and operation modes, assuming the network administrator has set up the external data processing platform/sources.
% The Ahuora Digital Twin Platform needs to be designed to support these requirements.
