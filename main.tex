\chapter*{Abstract}

Modern factories are equipped with a variety of sensors that monitor the state of the factory and products. To fully utilise this sensor data, the field of Digital Twinning is emerging, which combines live factory data, historical state, and a model of the factory to predict future states. The process of creating a digital twin lacks standardization. This project develops a standardised framework for creating digital twins of chemical plants, using the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform and industry standard data processing tools.
