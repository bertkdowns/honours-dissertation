% A Dissertation/Thesis is supposed to be an extended argument. 
% "Problem, solution, benifit" structure. or "what, so what, now what"
% Some potential structures:
% Ahuora doesn't support live data integration, so we need to research/develop effective methods for this. This report outlines the methods of live data integration, and evaluates their effectiveness in a case study.
% Industrial scada systems don't include modelling capabilities. This report shows how live data can be put into a model, and how this can be used to improve factory performance.
% There are already good frameworks for processing live data. So ahuora should be designed in a way that it can interoperate with these frameworks. This report outlines the requirements for ahuora to interoperate with these frameworks, and develops a prototype implementation.
% Ahuora needs to be integrated with existing systems for control and monitoring. However, we don't know what features ahuora needs to do this effectively. This report outlines the development work required to integrate ahuora with existing systems, using a case study to evaluate the effectiveness of the current progress.
% Factories currently process live data in traditional feedback loops: a Digital Twin Approach can improve this. We have developed a modular way of creating a digital twin that can process live data through Ahuora to make predictions, and evaluated it in a case study - this should be used in industry.
% Factories currently process live data in feedback loops: a digital twin approach can make this smarter. We have extended the Ahuora Simulation platform so it can be used as a Digital Twin platform for tracking a factory's state and mapking predictions, and evaluated it in a case study - this should be used in industry.

\chapter*{Abstract}

Modern factories are equipped with a variety of sensors that monitor the state of the factory and products. To fully utilise this sensor data, the field of Digital Twinning is emerging, which combines live factory data, historical state, and a model of the factory to predict future states. The process of creating a digital twin lacks standardization. This project presents a standardised framework for creating digital twins of chemical plants, using the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform and industry standard data processing tools. The framework is evaluated in a case study of a heat pump dryer, demonstrating the potential of digital twins to improve factory performance.

% TODO: Something about results and evaluation stuff.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisors, Tim Walmsley and Mark Apperley, for their guidance and support throughout this project. I would also like to thank the Ahuora project team for their assistance and feedback. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their encouragement and support.
