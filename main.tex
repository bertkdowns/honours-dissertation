% A Dissertation/Thesis is supposed to be an extended argument. 
% "Problem, solution, benifit" structure. or "what, so what, now what"
% Some potential structures:
% Ahuora doesn't support live data integration, so we need to research/develop effective methods for this. This report outlines the methods of live data integration, and evaluates their effectiveness in a case study.
% Industrial scada systems don't include modelling capabilities. This report shows how live data can be put into a model, and how this can be used to improve factory performance.
% There are already good frameworks for processing live data. So ahuora should be designed in a way that it can interoperate with these frameworks. This report outlines the requirements for ahuora to interoperate with these frameworks, and develops a prototype implementation.
% Ahuora needs to be integrated with existing systems for control and monitoring. However, we don't know what features ahuora needs to do this effectively. This report outlines the development work required to integrate ahuora with existing systems, using a case study to evaluate the effectiveness of the current progress.
% Factories currently process live data in traditional feedback loops: a Digital Twin Approach can improve this. We have developed a modular way of creating a digital twin that can process live data through Ahuora to make predictions, and evaluated it in a case study - this should be used in industry.
% Factories currently process live data in feedback loops: a digital twin approach can make this smarter. We have extended the Ahuora Simulation platform so it can be used as a Digital Twin platform for tracking a factory's state and mapking predictions, and evaluated it in a case study - this should be used in industry.

\chapter*{Abstract}

Digital twins combine live factory data, historical state, and a model of the factory to predict future states. This project shows how the process of creating a digital twin lacks standardization. A abstract framework for creating digital twins of chemical plants is presented, that builds on top of existing chemical simulation and data processing tools. The framework is implemented for steady-state process models within the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform. The framework is evaluated in a case study of a heat pump dryer, demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach.

\chapter{Roadmap of Future Development} \label{app:roadmap}

\Cref{fig:development_flowchart} breaks future development down into phases. Each phase is broken down into subtasks, identifiying the key challenges to overcome.

Phase 1 provides the core functionality: ingesting data, solving the simulation, and displaying the results. This is the minimum viable product, and is completed as part of this dissertation.

Phase 2 adds support for physics based modelling, optimisation, and control. The key challenges anticipated, including specifying input of the the time domain, holdup, and visualisation, come from the research conducted in \Cref{sec:dynamicmodelling}. Likewise, the key challenges from optimisation and control originate from the research in \Cref{sec:optimisationcontrol}. Based on research from the literature review and \Cref{sec:surrogatemodelling} surrogate modelling moves beyond IDAES alone, and may also include online learning methods, specified in the figure as ``Live Surrogate Modelling''. This was seperated out as Phase 3, because it is a wider goal, and less defined at this stage. 

Phase 2 and 3 are not developed in this project, but this long-term roadmap is a key research outcome. It proves that development has been done in an engineering context, with a clear understanding of future requirements and an anticipation of further work.
