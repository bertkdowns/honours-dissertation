\title{Surrogate Modelling in a Live Simulation Environment}

\author{Bert Downs }

\date{October 2024}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

% What background research is there?
% All the live data stuff
% all the idaes stuff
% all the surrogate modelling stuff
% all the physics informed stuff
% all the ahuora stuff

% What can we add?
% operator networks, more physics informed, but also a LIVE SYSTEM UPDATES not just historical data

% What is the plan?

% Ahuora makes a good case study as a plaform with a live simulation enviromnent
% but, we can make a more general solution for operator networks, in mathematical modelling, in live data
% we can also look at operator networks, in live data, which goes to mathematical modelling (no neural networks in the mathematical model)
% or maybe operator networks as a live surrogate of a mathematical model that's too slow to run/update in real time

% We can also look at the physics informed stuff, and how that can be used in a operator network. (?maybe)
